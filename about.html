			<h2> About</h2>
			<p>Initially my project was building a community garden at Hatch Workshop where people could come volunteer and receive community hours <br>
because of lack of communication and deadlines for college apps I delayed this project. Eventually I began working on it at home mid-January looking to<br>
 relocate at a later time. The week before projects were due I left for, for days leaving the plants to be watered by my family. When I returned home my plants had<br>
 been overwatered and withered. Due to the short timeline of a week before the due date I began to think of logical solutions. Fortunately I had purchased 100 mini <br>
potting containers I had unused. I used some of my soil filled each and planted different seeds. I left the lettuce, mixed greens, sunflowers, wildflowers, broccoli, and under a heating lamp with a cover to help them germinate as quickly as possible. My plan was to hold an event during school to give away each seedling so people could learn the skill of growing their own food.</p>

      <th scope="col">&nbsp;<p>I am Krla Mendez a Senior at Weber Institute. I have always enjoyed hands-on tasks and creating my own things as it leaves room for my creative mind to explore. I have joined a variety clubs and love to volunteer and work for my community. This is because I have grown and flourished into a very extroverted talker; I love to network and speak to anyone anytime about anything. Gardening and planting has always been a passion of mine as I love nature and being around it. yet I suppressed it in order to work on other aspect of my life. I chose this to finally revive this hobby of mine while simultaneously learning new things.

		  <p>The day of my event I had to confirm with my principal but had forgotten to submit an activity request which set a small bump in the road. It was easily resolved by speaking with Ms. Desantiago. I had many things to print and get set in place so I took my entire 4th period to prepare. When lunch came I had almost everyhting set up but my flyers. So throughout the activity they kept flying around due to the wind. I was nervous people would not show up but my friends came to support me and I had a good time! We joked around and I helped them plant their seeds!</p>
